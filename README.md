# EduContentLibrary Smart Contract

## Vision

The EduContentLibrary smart contract aims to create a decentralized platform for sharing and rewarding educational content. Contributors can upload their educational resources, and others can view and reward them in a transparent and immutable manner. By leveraging blockchain technology, this platform ensures fair compensation for content creators and fosters a collaborative learning environment.
